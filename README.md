Get started
Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/samvedna/Movies4u.git

Install npm packages:

npm install
npm start
The npm start command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into dist/, watches for changes to the source files, and runs lite-server on port 4200.

To run the application in production mode run ng serve --prod.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

npm scripts
These are the most useful commands defined in package.json:

npm start - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
npm run build - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
npm run build:watch - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into dist/.
